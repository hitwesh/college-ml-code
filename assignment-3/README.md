## Overview
This assignment contains multiple CNN architecture implementations for the Generative AI course. The outputs are provided in image format.

## Dataset
Download the dataset from:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yyn2g83vsy/1

After downloading, place the dataset in the expected location for the scripts (see `split_dataset.py`).

   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the dataset split script:
   ```
   python split_dataset.py
   ```
3. Run each CNN architecture script individually (example):
   ```
   python alexnet.py
   ```

Repeat step 3 for each architecture file in this folder.

## Outputs
The output results are provided in image format.
